## Purpose

This project was created to merge the possibilities of learning with LLMS and the benefits of learning in groups. 
One of the most influencial and powerful uses of LLMs is their ability to teach almost any subject in a conversational way, allowing learners to ask questions and fill in any learning gaps. 
However, by sharing project notes, resources, and other useful data with your study group, either up-front or under-the-hood, Coi aims to omptimize the learning process and make it more engaging than just chatting with an LLM.
